      <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
      <div class="lore-panel">
        <p>There used to be a player on this server who wanted control.</p>
        <p>Not attention. Not wealth. Control.</p>
        <p>He was not strong at first. He was not even important. But he was patient.</p>
        <p>While everyone else focused on building and fighting, he went looking for something deeper.</p>
        <p>That search led him to the Nether.</p>
        <p>Somewhere below the usual structures, he found something that should not have been there: an orb. It reacted to nearby deaths. It stored energy.</p>
        <p>He experimented.</p>
        <p>At first he tried using what was already in the Nether. Then what was left behind in the End.</p>
        <p>It barely worked.</p>
        <p>Eventually he figured it out.</p>
        <p>The strongest energy did not come from the dead.</p>
        <p>It came from the living.</p>
        <p>So he came back to the Overworld and started testing.</p>
        <p>Every battle. Every death. Every conflict made the orb stronger.</p>
        <p>And as it grew, so did he.</p>
        <p>He learned how to bind undead mobs.<br />He learned how to manipulate players.<br />He stopped asking for land and started taking it.</p>
        <p>The more power he pulled from others, the less stable he became.</p>
        <p>The orb was not just storing souls.</p>
        <p>It was changing him.</p>
        <p>He got paranoid. Aggressive. Obsessed.</p>
        <p>When people tried to stop him, he did not negotiate.</p>
        <p>He escalated.</p>
        <p>Eventually the rest of the server realized he could not just be killed. Every time he was close to losing, the orb reacted.</p>
        <p>So they did something else.</p>
        <p>They sealed him underground.</p>
        <p>Buried the orb with him.</p>
        <p>Locked both away.</p>
        <p>Not destroyed.</p>
        <p>Just contained.</p>
        <p>And now the seal is not holding the way it used to.</p>
        <p>The orb is active again.</p>
        <p>And if someone finds it, we will see whether they can use it...</p>
        <p>or whether it uses them.</p>
